# Advanced-Search-Filter-App
<br/>
 You can search the substring of a string also.

This is the advance search filter for android.
The standard text view adapter only seems to search from the beginning of whole words 
so we've had to write the whole StringAdapter class to make it possible to search 
for parts of the arbitrary string we want.<br/>
